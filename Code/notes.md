## âœ… 1. What is HTML and why is it called a markup language?

**Answer:**
HTML means **HyperText Markup Language**. It is used to **create the structure of a webpage**, like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.
It is called a **markup language** because it uses **tags** (like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`) to "mark" parts of content â€” to tell the browser **what each part is**.

ðŸ‘‰ Simple Example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

Here, `<p>` is a tag. It tells the browser: "This text is a paragraph."

---

## âœ… 2. What are the basic building blocks of an HTML document?

**Answer:**
Every HTML page is built using a **basic structure** with some important tags:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` â€“ tells browser this is HTML5
2. `<html>` â€“ main container for the whole page
3. `<head>` â€“ contains hidden info like title, CSS, metadata
4. `<body>` â€“ contains all visible content like text, images, forms

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is my first page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## âœ… 3. What is the role of `<!DOCTYPE html>`?

**Answer:**
`<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser,
**"This page is written in HTML5."**

It helps the browser understand **how to read and show** your HTML content correctly.

If you donâ€™t write this, browser may show the page with **old rules**, which can cause layout or display issues.

---

## âœ… 4. What is the difference between `<head>` and `<body>`?

**Answer:**

* `<head>` = for **information about the page** (not visible to users)
* `<body>` = for **everything that user can see** on the webpage

**`<head>` contains:** title, CSS links, meta info, favicon, etc.
**`<body>` contains:** text, headings, images, videos, buttons, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Simple View:

```html
<head>
  <title>This is title</title>   <!-- You see this in browser tab -->
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is visible content</h1>  <!-- You see this on the page -->
</body>
```

---

## âœ… 5. What are void (empty) elements? Give examples.

**Answer:**
Void elements are **tags that do not have closing tags**.
They are self-closing â€” they donâ€™t wrap any content.

ðŸ‘‰ Examples:

* `<br>` â€“ line break
* `<img>` â€“ image
* `<hr>` â€“ horizontal line
* `<input>` â€“ input field
* `<meta>` â€“ metadata info

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```html
<p>Hello<br>World</p>
```

Here `<br>` adds a new line between "Hello" and "World".

---

## âœ… 6. What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`?

**Answer:**
Both are container tags but used differently:

* `<div>` is a **block-level** element â†’ takes full width
* `<span>` is an **inline** element â†’ takes only the space it needs

Use `<div>` when you group **big sections**.
Use `<span>` when you style or group **small words/phrases** inside a line.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```html
<div>This is a block</div>
<span>This is inline</span>
```

---

## âœ… 7. What is the difference between `<br>`, `<hr>`, and `<p>` tags?

**Answer:**

* `<br>` = line break (goes to next line without space)
* `<hr>` = horizontal line (used for section break)
* `<p>` = paragraph (adds space before and after text)

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```html
<p>First paragraph</p>
<hr>
<p>Second paragraph</p>
```

---

## âœ… 8. How does the `<pre>` tag work and where should it be used?

**Answer:**
`<pre>` means **preformatted text**.
It shows text **exactly as you type** â€” spaces, tabs, new lines are preserved.

Useful when showing code or poetry.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

```html
<pre>
  Hello World
    This is indented
</pre>
```

---

## âœ… 9. What are semantic tags? Why are they important for SEO and accessibility?

**Answer:**

ðŸ‘‰ Examples: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`

They help:

* Search engines understand your page
* Screen readers help disabled users
* Developers understand the layout better

---

## âœ… 10. Compare `<div>` with semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, etc.

**Answer:**
`<div>` has **no meaning**, it is just a box.

* `<article>` for a blog/news post
