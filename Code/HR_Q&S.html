    <h2 style="color: darkblue;">Communication & HR Round Questions & Answers</h2>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">1. Tell me about yourself?</h3>
<p>I am a motivated and detail-oriented individual with a Master’s degree in Computer Applications (MCA 2024) and a passion for web development. I have hands-on experience working on real-world projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack. I’ve completed internships and created personal projects, including an e-commerce site and a travel application. I enjoy problem-solving and have solved over 300+ problems on LeetCode to sharpen my logic. Currently, I am seeking a full-time role to grow as a software developer and contribute meaningfully to a good tech team.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">2. What are your hobbies?</h3>
<p>I enjoy coding and building small web applications in my free time. I like solving coding problems on platforms like LeetCode and CodeStudio. Apart from that, I enjoy reading technology blogs and watching YouTube tutorials to explore new tech stacks. Offline, I love spending time with my daughter, sketching occasionally, and taking care of my physical health with daily walks or exercises. I also enjoy learning new things that can improve my productivity and communication skills.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">3. What are your strengths and weaknesses?</h3>
<p>One of my key strengths is my willingness to learn and adapt quickly to new technologies. I am disciplined, consistent, and take responsibility seriously. I also possess a strong sense of time management and complete my work on or before deadlines. As for weaknesses, I sometimes overthink or hesitate to ask for help. However, I am working on improving that by collaborating more and building confidence through mock interviews and teamwork.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">4. What are your short-term and long-term goals?</h3>
<p>My short-term goal is to join a reputed IT company where I can apply my skills in a real-world environment, gain more experience, and enhance my technical and soft skills. I want to work with smart people and solve challenging problems. My long-term goal is to become a senior full-stack developer or team lead, and contribute to high-impact projects. I also wish to guide and mentor junior developers, and possibly start my own tech-based initiative in the future.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">5. Where do you see yourself after 5 years?</h3>
<p>In five years, I see myself working in a senior position as a full-stack developer or a tech lead in a reputed IT company. I hope to be trusted with important decisions in project architecture and leading a small team. I also plan to contribute to open-source or community-based tech initiatives. Personally, I wish to move back to my native place and work remotely while managing responsibilities and promoting digital education in my village.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">6. Tell me something about your future plans and native place?</h3>
<p>I belong to Vishunpur Patti, a village in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar. In the long run, apart from building a successful career in software, I want to return to my native place and contribute to society through education, farming, and digital awareness. I have 2 acres of land, and I plan to explore smart farming techniques after establishing my tech career. I also wish to provide guidance and mentorship to local students interested in IT and programming.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">7. Why should I hire you?</h3>
<p>You should hire me because I bring dedication, a strong learning attitude, and solid foundational skills in web development. I may be a fresher, but I have already built several projects, solved hundreds of DSA problems, and continuously keep myself updated with new tools and technologies. I am adaptable, collaborative, and eager to contribute from day one. I am looking for a platform like yours where I can learn, contribute, and grow fast.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">8. How much do you rate yourself out of 10 in HTML?</h3>
<p>I would rate myself 8.5 out of 10 in HTML. I have a strong command of both basic and advanced HTML concepts, including forms, multimedia, semantic tags, tables, iframes, and accessibility. I’ve created several real-life projects and mock websites using clean HTML. I'm still learning some advanced accessibility and SEO-related best practices, which I plan to master with experience and ongoing projects.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">9. Any technology you want to learn in the future and why?</h3>
<p>Yes, I want to master the MERN stack completely, as I am currently focusing on it. It’s one of the most in-demand full-stack development stacks in the industry. I also plan to learn TypeScript, Next.js, and DevOps tools like Docker and CI/CD. These technologies will help me become a complete developer and allow me to handle both front-end and back-end tasks more efficiently. Continuous learning is important in tech, and I enjoy that process.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">10. How do you know about us?</h3>
<p>I came to know about your company through LinkedIn, where I follow job updates and company news. I also heard about your organization from my peers and mentors who recommended you for your excellent training and work culture. After visiting your website and going through your current openings and project domains, I felt it’s a perfect match for my profile and learning goals.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">11. Why do you want to join us?</h3>
<p>I want to join your company because I am impressed by the kind of work you do and the learning environment you provide. As a fresher, I am looking for a place that focuses on growth, mentorship, and challenges. Your organization offers exposure to real-time projects and promotes continuous improvement, which aligns perfectly with my goals. I believe this is the right place where I can learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to your success.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">12. How much salary are you expecting?</h3>
<p>As a fresher, my main goal is to gain knowledge and experience. I am open to a salary that aligns with the company’s fresher hiring policy. However, I would appreciate fair compensation based on my skills, project experience, and performance in the interview. I believe if I work hard and prove myself, salary growth will naturally follow with time and value addition.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkred;">13. Are you comfortable to relocate and work in night shift and why?</h3>
<p>Yes, I am fully comfortable with relocation and working in night shifts if the job demands it. I understand that certain roles or support projects may require night shifts or different locations. I am flexible, career-focused, and willing to make any adjustment that helps me grow as a professional and serve the organization better. For me, learning and contributing are the top priorities.</p>
